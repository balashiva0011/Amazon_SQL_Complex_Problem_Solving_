### **Difficulty Level: Advanced**

---

## **Project Overview**

I have worked on analyzing a dataset of over 20,000 sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform. This project involves extensive querying of customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends using PostgreSQL. Through this project, I have tackled various SQL problems, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management.

The project also focuses on data cleaning, handling null values, and solving real-world business problems using structured queries.

An ERD diagram is included to visually represent the database schema and relationships between tables.
